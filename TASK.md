  - Create success/failure pages
  - Test mobile device compatibility

- [ ] **API Enhancements**
  - Add payment status webhooks for merchants
  - Implement payment history endpoints
  - Add invoice cancellation functionality
  - Create API documentation
  - Add rate limiting by customer email

#### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] **Production Testing**
  - End-to-end testing with real Lightning payments
  - Load testing for concurrent payments
  - Security penetration testing
  - Performance optimization
  - User acceptance testing

- [ ] **Deployment Automation**
  - Update GitHub Actions workflow
  - Add environment variable validation
  - Implement blue-green deployment
  - Set up rollback procedures
  - Create deployment documentation

## Current Blockers
- None identified

## Discovered During Work
*Add any new tasks or issues found during development*

## Technical Debt
- Current mock Lightning implementation needs replacement
- Environment variable management needs improvement
- API error handling could be more comprehensive
- Database schema may need optimization for BTCPay integration

## Notes
- BTCPay Server chosen as the Lightning provider due to zero-KYB requirements
- Production deployment target: DigitalOcean droplet 138.197.83.231
- GitHub repo: blinds123/lightning-payment-auto
- Supabase database already configured and linked
